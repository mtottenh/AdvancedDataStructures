Algorithm and DataStrucutre Practice
====================================
This repo contains the course notes and some supporting code in C++ for the following MIT Courses:
* Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs [(6.001)](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)
* Introduction To Algorithms [(6.006)](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/fall11/notes.shtml)
* Algorithm Design [(6.046)](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp14/6.046/index.html)
* Avanced Algorithm Design [(6.854)](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.854/current/)
* Advanced Data Structures [(6.851)](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring14/)

```
Note: An effort will be made to keep this repo up to date as possible, but for the 
**real** MIT experence, I suggest you attend yourself ;)

Introduction to Algorithms and Algorithm Design
-----------------------------------------------
From what I can gather, **6.006** and **6.046** are *similar*.
**6.006** has video lectures from **2011** posted online covering the following topics:

1. **Intro & Model of computation**
2. **Sorting**
  * Insertion sort, Merge Sort
  * Heaps and Heap sort
  * BSTs and BST sort
  * AVL Trees and AVL sort
  * Counting/Radix sort & Lower bounds for sorting
3. **Hashing**
  * Hashing & Chaining
  * Simulation Algoritms
  * Table Doubling 
  * Open Addressing, Cryptographic Hashing
4. **Numerics**
  * Karatsuba Multiplication & Integer Arithmetic
  * Netwons Method/Square Roots
5. **Graphs**
  * BFS
  * DFS
  * Topological Sorting
6. **Shortest Paths**
  * Single Source Problem
  * Dijkstra & Optimizations
  * Bellman-Ford
7. **Dynamic Programming**
  * Memoization
  * Parent Pointers
  * String Subproblems
  * *Guessing* Problems
8. **Advanced Topics**
  * Computaitonal Complexity
  * Research Topics

Whereas **6.046** doesn't have video lectures, but notes from **2011** covering:

1. **Intro & Interval scheduling**
2. **Divide and conquore**
3. **FFTs**
4. **Randomized Algorithms**
6. **Universal Hashing**
7. **Amortized Alogihtms**
8. **Dynamic Programming**
