Algorithm and DataStrucutre Practice
====================================
This repo contains the course notes and some supporting code in C++ for the following MIT Courses:
* [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](./doc/6_001/CourseOverview.md) [(**6.001**)](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-001-structure-and-interpretation-of-computer-programs-spring-2005/)
* [Introduction To Algorithms](./doc/6_006/CourseOverview.md) [(**6.006**)](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.006/fall11/notes.shtml)
* [Algorithm Design](./doc/6_046/CourseOverview.md) [(**6.046**)](http://stellar.mit.edu/S/course/6/sp14/6.046/index.html)**
* [Avanced Algorithm Design](./doc/6_854/CourseOverview.md) [(**6.854**)](http://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.854/current/)*
* [Advanced Data Structures](./doc/6_851/CourseOverview.md) [(**6.851**)](https://courses.csail.mit.edu/6.851/spring14/)

Click the course title to take you to an overview of the course, and the course code
to take you to the official MIT page for the course from that year. (Mostly 2011/2014).

These courses are *meant* to be studied in the above order, i.e.  **6.001** --> **6.006** --> **6.046** --> **6.851** --> **6.854**

```
Note: An effort will be made to keep this repo up to date as possible, but for the 
**real** MIT experence, I suggest you attend yourself ;)
