Peak Finding Problem
====================
Toy Problem to design an efficeint algorithm.

1D: Array of numbers |a|b|c|d|e|f|g|h|i|

a=>i are numbers, find a *peak* where a peak is defined as:
Position 2 is a peak if and only if, b >= a and b >= c

```
The edges only have to look to one side
```

Problem
-------
*Find a peak if it exists* 

Straight forward algorithm:
* Start from left
