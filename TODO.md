merge_sort(): Currently this takes up O(n lg n) space as I create a new set of
vectors each split, I suppose there is the possibility of overflowing the stack
for very large elements. Fix split()

Heaps: 
make this class generic
Implment the switch for minheap vs maxheap

BST
finish basic BST implementation.

AVL Tree
Finish implementation

Red Black Tree
Finish implmeentation
